Given the `head` of a linked list, return the `list` after `sorting` it in `ascending order`.

Example:
```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]

Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
```

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
